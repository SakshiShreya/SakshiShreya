### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Frontend web developer in Edelweiss Financial Services.

Other than office work I usually prefer doing something which can help me learn something new everyday.

That something may be **doing a course, reading blogs, making side projects, teaching**, cooking, painting, singing, reading a novel...

You may find thing related to the **bold topics** in this repo.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making my portfolio site.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Advanced TypeScript
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any fun project related to web development. I am ready to learn backend.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I rebuild my portfolio each year. Each one having a link to all previous portfolio. [Current Portfolio](https://sakshishreya.github.io/#/) (This year's portfolio is pending).
